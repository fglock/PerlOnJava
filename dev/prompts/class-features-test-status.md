## Key Implementation Breakthroughs

### 1. Field Inheritance via FieldRegistry and SUPER::new()
- Created global FieldRegistry to track fields and parent relationships at parse time
- Constructor generation detects parent class and calls `$class->SUPER::new(%args)`
- Parent fields properly initialized through delegation
- Inherited field access works via compile-time field checking

### 2. Field Operators and Dereferencing
- Implemented `//=` (defined-or) and `||=` (logical-or) operators in FieldParser
- ClassTransformer handles conditional field initialization correctly
- Fixed array/hash field dereferencing: `@field` → `@{$self->{field}}`
- Fields with "field" declaration skipped in closure processing

### 3. Method Forward Declarations and Lexical Methods
- Added support for `method name;` syntax without body
- Lexical methods via AST transformation: `my method x` → `my $x__lexmethod_123 = sub`
- ClassTransformer detects and transforms lexical method assignments
- $self injection works for lexical methods

## Complex Problems Analysis & Priorities

### 🔴 HIGH COMPLEXITY - HIGH IMPACT
1. **Lexical Method Call Resolution** (method.t)
   - `$self->&priv()` needs to resolve to hidden variable
   - Requires symbol table modifications and call-site transformation
   - Complex but would complete method.t support

2. **DESTROY Block Support** (destruct.t)
   - Needs destructor mechanism integration
   - Requires runtime finalization hooks
   - Essential for resource management

### 🟠 MEDIUM COMPLEXITY - HIGH IMPACT
3. **Writer Methods** (accessor.t)
   - Generate setter methods with :writer attribute
   - Similar to reader generation but with assignment
   - Would improve accessor.t from 39% to ~70%

4. **__CLASS__ in Inheritance** (inherit.t)
   - Currently returns parent class instead of child
   - Needs runtime context tracking
   - Would complete inherit.t to 100%

### 🟢 LOW COMPLEXITY - QUICK WINS
5. **reftype() Function** (construct.t)
   - Single function implementation
   - Would complete construct.t to 100%

6. **Version Checking in :isa()** (inherit.t)
   - Parse version constraints in :isa attribute
   - Add version validation
   - Small improvement to inherit.t

## Recommended Priority Order

Based on complexity-to-impact ratio:

1. **Fix reftype()** - Quick win for construct.t (75% → 100%)
2. **Complete lexical method calls** - Unlock method.t completely
3. **Implement :writer** - Major accessor.t improvement (39% → 70%+)
4. **Fix __CLASS__ context** - Complete inherit.t (78% → 100%)
5. **DESTROY blocks** - Enable destruct.t (new functionality)

## Critical Issues to Fix

### 1. Field Variable Scoping in Methods (HIGH PRIORITY)
**Problem**: Fields declared with `field $x` are not available as lexical variables within methods.

**Current Behavior**:
```perl
class Test {
    field $x :param;
    method get_x { return $x; }  # ERROR: $x not in scope
}
```

**Required Behavior**:
```perl
class Test {
    field $x :param;
    method get_x { return $x; }  # Should work - $x is lexically available
}
```

**Workaround**: Currently must use `$self->{x}` to access fields.

### 2. Constructor Generation Fix Applied
**Fixed Issue**: Constructors are now generated for ALL classes, even those without fields or ADJUST blocks.
- Previously failed for classes with only methods
- Now all classes get a basic constructor that blesses and returns an object

## Features Needing Implementation

### Essential for Basic Compatibility
1. **Field lexical scoping in methods** - Critical for most tests
2. **`:isa()` attribute** - Required for inheritance tests
3. **`:writer` attribute** - For setter methods

### Nice to Have
1. **Unit class syntax** - `class Name;` without block
2. **Method forward declarations** - `method name;`
3. **`//=` and `||=` field operators**
4. **DESTROY blocks in classes**

## Implementation Recommendations

1. **Immediate Priority**: Fix field scoping in methods
   - This is the most critical issue preventing tests from passing
   - Would make construct.t and other tests work

2. **Next Priority**: Implement `:isa()` attribute
   - Enables inheritance tests
   - Important for real-world usage

3. **Future Work**: Add `:writer`, forward declarations, and other features

## Technical Notes

### ADJUST Blocks Implementation (COMPLETE)
- Compiled as anonymous SubroutineNodes
- Full closure support for lexical variables
- Stored in `parser.classAdjustBlocks`
- Called by constructor with `$self` as parameter
- Multiple blocks run in declaration order

### Constructor Generation (FIXED)
- Changed from conditional to unconditional generation
- ALL classes now get constructors
- Fixes issues with method-only and ADJUST-only classes

### Storage Locations
- Fields: Stored as hash keys in blessed object
- Methods: Transformed with implicit `$self = shift`
- ADJUST blocks: Stored as anonymous subs, called in constructor

### IMPORTANT IMPLEMENTATION NOTE - Field Aliases in Methods
**USE ALIASES** (recently implemented feature!) for field access in methods:

Instead of copying values:
```perl
my $field1 = $self->{field1};  # WRONG - creates a copy
```

Use aliases to create direct references:
```perl
# CREATE ALIAS - modifications to $field1 will affect $self->{field1}
# Implementation should inject field aliases at method start
```

This ensures that:
- Field modifications within methods work correctly
- Performance is optimized (no copying)
- Semantics match Perl's class field behavior
- Both read and write access work as expected

## Summary
The Perl 5.38+ class features implementation in PerlOnJava has made significant progress with ADJUST blocks fully working and constructor generation fixed. The main remaining issue is field variable scoping in methods, which affects several tests. Once this is resolved, basic class functionality will be largely complete, with inheritance being the next major feature to implement.
