## Architecture Overview

The adapter would essentially act as a bridge, translating between Perl scripts and Spark's Java/Scala APIs. You'd have several architectural options:

**1. JVM-native Integration**
Since both PerlOnJava and Spark run on the JVM, you can create a direct integration where:
- Your adapter exposes Spark functionality as Java classes/methods
- PerlOnJava scripts call these Java methods directly
- Data flows between Perl and Spark through JVM objects

**2. Workflow Definition Layer**
Create a higher-level abstraction where:
- Perl scripts define workflow logic and data transformations
- The adapter translates these into Spark job definitions
- Spark handles the distributed execution

## Key Components

**Data Serialization Bridge**
- Convert between Perl data structures and Spark DataFrames/RDDs
- Handle common types: arrays, hashes, scalars
- Support for custom serializers for complex Perl objects

**API Wrapper Layer**
- Wrap core Spark operations (map, filter, reduce, join, etc.)
- Provide Perl-friendly method signatures
- Handle Spark context and session management

**Execution Engine**
- Submit Perl-defined transformations as Spark jobs
- Handle distributed execution of Perl code snippets
- Manage cluster resources and job scheduling

## Implementation Approach

You could start with a basic adapter that:
1. Allows Perl scripts to create and manipulate Spark DataFrames
2. Supports basic transformations with Perl lambda functions
3. Handles common I/O operations (reading/writing files, databases)
