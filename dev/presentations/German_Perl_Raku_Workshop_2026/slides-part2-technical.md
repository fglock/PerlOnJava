# PerlOnJava — Technical Deep-Dive

## From Perl Source to JVM Bytecode

German Perl/Raku Workshop 2026 — Flavio Glock

*Part 2: 40-minute technical talk — progressively more technical*

---

# Section 1: Compilation Pipeline

*How do you compile a language that wasn't designed to be compiled?*

---

## Compilation Approaches

**Perl 5 (traditional):**
- Builds OP tree → peephole optimizations → runs

**PerlOnJava (dual backend):**
```
Perl Source → Compiler → JVM Bytecode → JVM Execution
                       ↘ Custom Bytecode → Internal VM
```

Shared frontend + shared runtime, two execution paths.

Note:
Why not transpile to Java source? Perlito5 (predecessor) compiled Perl → Java → bytecode. Efficient, but slower startup and `eval STRING` invokes the Java compiler at runtime. PerlOnJava generates bytecode directly.

---

## Lexer: Tokenization

Breaks source into tokens: identifiers, operators, keywords.

```perl
my $café_123 = 42;        # Valid
my $𝕦𝕟𝕚𝕔𝕠𝕕𝕖 = "test";      # Surrogate pairs
```

**Challenge:** Characters beyond U+FFFF need surrogate pair handling.

**Solution:** IBM's ICU4J library for Unicode code points.

Note:
Perl limits identifiers to 251 code points; ICU4J handles code points rather than UTF-16 units.

---

## Parser: Building the AST

**Three-layer architecture:**

1. **Recursive descent** (`StatementParser`, `ParseBlock`)
   - Control structures, declarations, subroutines, special blocks

2. **Precedence climbing** (`Parser.parseExpression`)
   - Operator precedence, associativity, ternary, method calls

3. **Operator-specific parsers** (20+ specialized)
   - `StringParser`, `PackParser`, `SprintfFormatParser`
   - `NumberParser`, `IdentifierParser`, `SignatureParser`

Produces AST nodes: `BlockNode`, `BinaryOperatorNode`, `ListNode`. Modular — easy to add new syntax.

---

## Special Blocks: BEGIN, END, INIT, CHECK

```perl
my @data;
BEGIN {
    @data = qw(a b c);  # Runs during compilation
    say "Compiling...";
}
say @data;  # Uses data set by BEGIN
```

Parser encounters `BEGIN` → wraps as anonymous sub → **executes immediately** → captures lexical variables.

`use Module` is sugar for `BEGIN { require Module; Module->import() }`

Note:
Other special blocks: END runs at program exit, INIT runs after compilation before runtime, CHECK runs after compilation in reverse order, UNITCHECK runs after each compilation unit. Behavior follows the Perl test suite; some edge cases not yet implemented.

---

## EmitterVisitor: Bytecode Generation

**What it does:**
- Traverses AST → generates JVM bytecode via ASM library
- Manages symbol tables
- Context propagation (void/scalar/list)

**Key challenge:** The JVM imposes a **64KB limit per method**. Large Perl subroutines can exceed this.

**Solution:** Automatic fallback to the Internal VM for oversized methods.

---

## Sublanguage Parsing

**Perl embeds multiple DSLs — each with its own parser:**

1. Regular expressions: `m/pattern/flags`
2. Pack/unpack templates: `pack("N*", @values)`
3. Sprintf format strings: `sprintf("%d", $n)`
4. Transliteration: `tr/a-z/A-Z/`
5. String interpolation: `"Value: $x\n"`

Each validates at compile time and generates optimized bytecode.

---

## Sublanguage Example: String Interpolation

```perl
my $name = "World";
my $msg = "Hello $name!\n";
```

**Generated AST** (from `./jperl --parse`):
```
BinaryOperatorNode: =
  OperatorNode: my
    OperatorNode: $
      IdentifierNode: 'msg'
  BinaryOperatorNode: join
    StringNode: empty
    ListNode:
      StringNode: 'Hello '
      OperatorNode: $
        IdentifierNode: 'name'
      StringNode: '!\x0A'
```

Compile-time validation catches errors early.

---

# Section 2: Dual Execution Model

*Why would you need two execution engines?*

---

## Why Two Backends?

JVM bytecode is the primary path — but three problems need a second backend:

1. **64KB method size limit** — large Perl subs exceed it
2. **CPU cache pressure** — sparse JVM bytecode overflows instruction caches
3. **ClassLoader overhead** — `eval STRING` pays per-class cost

The Internal VM solves all three.

Note:
This is a common VM design pattern: HotSpot, V8, SpiderMonkey, CRuby all use tiered execution for similar reasons.

---

## JVM Backend: The Fast Path

**Loop increment, 1 billion iterations:**
- Perl 5: **7.88s**
- PerlOnJava: **3.57s** (2.2× faster)

After JIT warmup (~10K iterations), the JVM inlines and unrolls hot loops.

Note:
Pipeline: AST → ASM → JVM bytecode → ClassLoader. Best for long-running code with hot loops.

---

## JVM Tiered Compilation

**HotSpot progressively optimizes hot code:**

- **Tier 0:** Interpreter — collects profiling data
- **Tier 1–3:** C1 Compiler — fast compilation
- **Tier 4:** C2 Compiler — aggressive inlining, peak performance

**Key insight:** Keep critical paths ≤ 35 bytecodes for inlining.

This is why we split methods into fast/slow paths.

Note:
Default thresholds: MaxInlineSize=35, FreqInlineSize=325.

---

## Optimization Example: Fast/Slow Path Split

**Hot path (≤ 35 bytecodes — inlineable):**
```java
public int getInt() {
    if (type == INTEGER) {
        return (int) this.value;  // ~2ns
    }
    return getIntLarge();  // Call slow path
}
```

**Cold path (rare cases):**
```java
private int getIntLarge() {
    return switch (type) {
        case DOUBLE -> (int) ((double) value);
        case STRING -> NumberParser.parseNumber(this).getInt();
        case TIED_SCALAR -> this.tiedFetch().getInt();
        default -> Overload.numify(this).getInt();
    };
}
```

90%+ calls hit INTEGER → single-digit nanoseconds when inlined.

Note:
This pattern is used throughout: getDouble(), toString(), getBoolean().

---

## Custom Bytecode Backend: Compact and Flexible

- No method size limits
- Lower startup overhead — no class generation
- 65,536 virtual registers
- Good fit for `eval`-heavy scripts

Switch-based VM with ~200 opcodes.

Note:
Peak throughput is lower than the JVM backend, but startup is faster and there are no size constraints.

---

## Why Register-Based?

```perl
eval {
    for my $i (1..10) {
        goto LABEL if $i > 5;
    }
};
LABEL: print "Jumped out!\n";
```

- **Stack-based:** Stack state becomes inconsistent on non-local jumps
- **Register-based:** Explicit operands (`rd = rs1 op rs2`) maintain correctness regardless of control flow

Perl's complex control flow — labeled loops, `goto`, `eval` — requires register architecture.

---

## eval STRING: Avoiding the ClassLoader

**1,000,000 unique eval strings:**

| Implementation | Time |
|----------------|------|
| Perl 5 | 1.29s |
| PerlOnJava (Internal VM) | 2.78s |

The Internal VM avoids ClassLoader overhead — each eval compiles directly to register bytecode without generating a JVM class.

Note:
Set JPERL_EVAL_USE_INTERPRETER=1. Each iteration evals a different string, so compilation overhead dominates. For typical eval usage with repeated patterns, performance is much closer.

---

# Section 3: Complex Language Features

*What makes Perl the hardest language to implement on the JVM?*

---

## Runtime Data Structures

**Five core classes — shared by both backends:**

1. **RuntimeScalar** — dynamically typed value
2. **RuntimeArray** — dynamic list with autovivification
3. **RuntimeHash** — associative array
4. **RuntimeCode** — compiled sub (`MethodHandle` or `InterpretedCode`)
5. **RuntimeGlob** — typeglob with slot delegation

Note:
RuntimeScalar supports: integer, double, string, reference, undef, regex, glob, tied, dualvar. RuntimeArray and RuntimeHash support plain, autovivifying, tied, and read-only modes. Context tracking, auto-vivification, and string/number coercion are implemented consistently across both backends.

---

## RuntimeScalar: Three Fields

1. **`int blessId`** — `0` unblessed, `> 0` blessed, `< 0` has overloads
2. **`int type`** — `INTEGER`, `DOUBLE`, `STRING`, `UNDEF`, references…
3. **`Object value`** — the actual data

Type field determines how to interpret the value.

Note:
Full type list: INTEGER, DOUBLE, STRING, UNDEF, BOOLEAN, TIED_SCALAR, DUALVAR, plus reference types with high bit set: CODE, ARRAYREFERENCE, HASHREFERENCE, REGEX, GLOBREFERENCE.

---

## RuntimeScalar: Overload Optimization

**Negative `blessId`** → class has overloads → check `OverloadContext`

**Positive `blessId`** → skip expensive lookup

~10–20ns saved per operation. Detection happens once at `bless` time.

Note:
This is a critical optimization because overload checks happen on nearly every operation on blessed references.

---

## RuntimeScalar in Action

```perl
my $x = "10";
my $y = $x + 5;        # String → number: 15
my $z = $x . " cats";  # Number → string: "10 cats"
```

**Context-aware type coercion** — the same variable is both string and number.

```perl
my @arr;
$arr[10] = "x";        # Auto-expands to 11 elements
my $count = @arr;      # Scalar context: returns length
```

**Auto-vivification** — `RuntimeArray` auto-expands on assignment.

---

## Unicode and String Handling

**Challenge:** Java UTF-16 vs Perl's flexible encoding

```perl
my $emoji = "👍";  # U+1F44D
say length($emoji);  # Must return 1, not 2
say ord($emoji);     # Must return 128077
```

Java uses 2 UTF-16 code units for emoji; Perl counts code points.

**Solution:** `Character.toCodePoint()`, `codePointCount()`, and dual representation in pack/unpack.

---

## Control Flow: Non-Local Jumps

```perl
OUTER: for my $i (1..10) {
    INNER: for my $j (1..10) {
        last OUTER if $i * $j > 50;
        next INNER if $j == 5;
    }
}
```

**Implementation:** Tagged return values (`RuntimeControlFlowList`).

- Returns carry a control-flow tag (last/next/redo/goto/tail-call) + target label
- Caller checks tag and dispatches accordingly
- Untagged lists → normal execution continues
- Implements `goto &sub` (tail calls) and non-local jumps safely

---

## Control Flow: Why It's Hard

1. Block-level dispatchers with label tracking
2. `die` → Java exceptions; `eval` → try-catch
3. **Tagged return values** for cross-boundary jumps

Register architecture is essential — stack state would corrupt on non-local jumps.

Note:
Registers maintain state explicitly. Label → bytecode offset mapping with shared handlers for multiple exits.

---

## Closures and Lexical Scoping

```perl
sub make_counter {
    my $count = 0;
    return sub { return ++$count };
}
my $c = make_counter();
say $c->();  # 1
say $c->();  # 2
```

**JVM backend:** Each anonymous sub → new JVM class. All visible lexicals passed as constructor arguments. Captured variables shared by Java reference — mutations visible to both scopes.

**Internal VM:** Dedicated opcode for closure variable allocation, same runtime objects.

---

## Context Propagation and `wantarray`

```perl
sub flexible {
    return wantarray ? (1, 2, 3) : 42;
}
my @arr = flexible();   # list context → (1, 2, 3)
my $n   = flexible();   # scalar context → 42
```

Context threaded through the entire call stack as `EmitterContext` during code generation. At each call site, the compiler emits the correct context flag. `wantarray` reads this flag at runtime. Works in both backends.

---

## `local` and Dynamic Scoping

```perl
our $x = "global";
sub inner { say $x }

sub outer {
    local $x = "dynamic";
    inner();               # prints "dynamic"
}
inner();  # "global"
outer();  # "dynamic"
inner();  # "global" again
```

Saves the current value onto a save stack; restores on scope exit — even through `die`/`eval`. Implemented for scalars, arrays, hashes, typeglobs, and filehandles.

---

## `tie`: Attaching Behavior to Variables

```perl
package MyScalar;
sub TIESCALAR { bless { val => $_[1] }, $_[0] }
sub FETCH     { say "reading!"; $_[0]{val} }
sub STORE     { say "writing!"; $_[0]{val} = $_[1] }

package main;
tie my $x, 'MyScalar', 42;
$x = 10;   # prints "writing!"
say $x;    # prints "reading!" then 10
```

`TIED_SCALAR` type in `RuntimeScalar` dispatches `FETCH`/`STORE` transparently. Supported for scalars, arrays, hashes, and filehandles.

---

## Regular Expressions

Uses **Java's regex engine** with a Perl compatibility layer:

- **RegexPreprocessor** translates Perl syntax → Java syntax
- Character classes: `[:ascii:]` → `\p{ASCII}`
- Case folds: `ß` → `(?:ß|ss|SS)`
- All modifiers: `/i`, `/g`, `/x`, `/xx`, `/e`, `/ee`

Cache of 1000 compiled patterns.

Note:
Also handles octal escapes, named Unicode (\N{name}), and surrogate pairs. Unsupported: recursive patterns, variable-length lookbehind. RuntimeRegex manages matching, captures, and special variables ($1, $&, etc.).

---

## Typeglobs: No Materialized Globs

**Separate global maps** for each slot type:
- `globalVariables` → SCALAR, `globalArrays` → ARRAY
- `globalHashes` → HASH, `globalCodeRefs` → CODE

**Glob assignment creates aliases:**
```java
// *foo = *bar
globalArrays.put("foo", globalArrays.get("bar"));
```

Lazy initialization — only allocated slots consume memory.

Note:
Also: globalIORefs → IO, globalFormatRefs → FORMAT. Slot access: *foo{CODE} → GlobalVariable.getGlobalCodeRef("foo"). Full Perl glob semantics without JVM Gv structures.

---

## Module Loading

`require` converts `Module::Name` → `Module/Name.pm`, searches `@INC`, caches in `%INC`.

**300+ modules bundled inside the JAR:**
```
%INC: 'Data/Dumper.pm' =>
  'file:/path/to/perlonjava.jar!/lib/Data/Dumper.pm'
```

---

## XSLoader: Java Instead of C

- Loads **Java extensions** instead of C shared libraries
- **JNA** (Java Native Access) replaces XS for native calls
- No C compiler needed

Note:
Java equivalents are easier to write and maintain than C/XS. The same API surface is exposed to Perl code.

---

# Section 4: Integration & Future

---

## JSR-223: Embed Perl in Java

JSR-223 is the standard Java scripting API (JDK since Java 6).

```java
ScriptEngineManager manager = new ScriptEngineManager();
ScriptEngine perl = manager.getEngineByName("perl");

perl.put("data", myJavaObject);
Object result = perl.eval("process_data($data)");
```

**Bidirectional:** Java ↔ Perl seamlessly.

**Use case:** Embed legacy Perl scripts in a modern Java application without rewriting them.

---

## Future Targets

**Current:** Standard JVM (HotSpot)

1. **GraalVM** — native executables, instant startup
2. **Android DEX** — Perl on mobile devices

The Internal VM is the key — custom bytecode is platform-independent and portable to any JVM derivative.

Note:
This is why the dual backend matters beyond performance. GraalVM native image gives standalone executables with smaller footprint. Android DEX converts JVM bytecode to Dalvik bytecode.

---

## Current Limitations

**JVM-incompatible:**
- `fork` — not available on JVM
- `DESTROY` — JVM uses non-deterministic GC
- Threading — not yet implemented

**Partially implemented:**
- Some regex features, taint checks

Note:
Workarounds: JNA for native access, Java threading APIs, file auto-close at exit. XS modules use Java equivalents.

---

## Roadmap

**Stable now:** JVM backend, Perl class features, IPC, sockets

**In progress:** Internal VM optimization, eval STRING performance

**Next:** More compatible regex engine, single-step debugger

## Perl Was Never Designed to Run on the JVM

We made it work anyway — and made it **2.2× faster**.

<span class="metric">260,000+ tests</span> · <span class="metric">392 files</span> · <span class="metric">5,741 commits</span>

No formal spec exists. The tests **are** the specification.

Note:
This is test-driven development at its most extreme — 260,000 tests define the language behavior.
