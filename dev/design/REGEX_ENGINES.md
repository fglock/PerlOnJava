# Strategy for Supporting Multiple Regex Engines in PerlOnJava

## Overview

The goal of this document is to outline a strategy for integrating multiple regex engines into the PerlOnJava project. This will allow the system to support different regex engines such as Java's built-in regex, RE2J, and ICU4J, providing flexibility and performance benefits depending on the use case. This document will guide the implementation team through the necessary steps to achieve this integration.

## Objectives

1. **Abstract Regex Operations**: Define interfaces that abstract the operations common to all regex engines.
2. **Implement Adapters**: Create adapter classes for each regex engine that implement these interfaces.
3. **Modify Existing Classes**: Update existing classes, such as `RuntimeRegex`, to utilize these interfaces.
4. **Ensure Compatibility**: Maintain compatibility with existing functionality and ensure that the new system is extensible for future regex engines.

## Architecture

### 1. Define Interfaces

We will define two primary interfaces to abstract the regex operations:

- **RegexPattern Interface**: Represents a compiled regex pattern.
  - `RegexMatcher matcher(String input)`: Returns a matcher for the given input string.

- **RegexMatcher Interface**: Represents the operations that can be performed with a regex pattern.
  - `boolean matches()`: Checks if the entire input sequence matches the pattern.
  - `String replaceAll(String replacement)`: Replaces every subsequence of the input sequence that matches the pattern with the given replacement string.

### 2. Implement Adapters

For each regex engine, implement the `RegexPattern` and `RegexMatcher` interfaces.

#### Java Regex Adapter

- **JavaRegexPattern**: Implements `RegexPattern` using Java's `Pattern`.
- **JavaRegexMatcher**: Implements `RegexMatcher` using Java's `Matcher`.

#### RE2J Adapter

- **Re2jRegexPattern**: Implements `RegexPattern` using RE2J's `Pattern`.
- **Re2jRegexMatcher**: Implements `RegexMatcher` using RE2J's `Matcher`.

#### ICU4J Adapter

- **Icu4jRegexPattern**: Implements `RegexPattern` using ICU4J's regex capabilities.
- **Icu4jRegexMatcher**: Implements `RegexMatcher` using ICU4J's regex capabilities.

### 3. Modify Existing Classes

Update the `RuntimeRegex` class to use the new interfaces. This involves:

- Replacing direct usage of Java's `Pattern` and `Matcher` with `RegexPattern` and `RegexMatcher`.
- Allowing the selection of the regex engine at runtime, possibly through configuration or a factory pattern.

### 4. Factory Pattern for Engine Selection

Implement a factory class to manage the creation of `RegexPattern` instances based on the desired regex engine. This factory will:

- Read configuration settings to determine which regex engine to use.
- Instantiate the appropriate `RegexPattern` adapter.

### 5. Caching Strategy

Maintain the existing caching strategy in `RuntimeRegex` to ensure compiled patterns are reused efficiently. Ensure that the cache can handle patterns from different engines without conflict.

### 6. Testing and Validation

- **Unit Tests**: Develop comprehensive unit tests for each adapter to ensure they conform to the expected behavior.
- **Integration Tests**: Test the integration of multiple regex engines within the PerlOnJava environment.
- **Performance Testing**: Evaluate the performance of each regex engine to guide users in selecting the appropriate engine for their needs.

## Implementation Plan

1. **Define Interfaces**: Create `RegexPattern` and `RegexMatcher` interfaces.
2. **Develop Adapters**: Implement adapters for Java, RE2J, and ICU4J regex engines.
3. **Update RuntimeRegex**: Modify `RuntimeRegex` to use the new interfaces and integrate the factory pattern.
4. **Implement Factory**: Develop a factory class for regex engine selection.
5. **Testing**: Conduct unit, integration, and performance testing.
6. **Documentation**: Update documentation to reflect changes and provide guidance on using different regex engines.
