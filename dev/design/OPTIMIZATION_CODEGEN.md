optimization opportunities for the dynamic code evaluation process:

Class Pooling:
Instead of creating a new class for each subroutine, implement a pool of reusable class templates
Classes with similar closure variable patterns could be reused
This would reduce the memory overhead of loading many similar classes

Method Handle Caching:
Cache MethodHandles for frequently called subroutines
Currently each call goes through reflection and method handle creation
A MethodHandle cache would improve repeated invocation performance

Bytecode Template System:
Create pre-compiled bytecode templates for common subroutine patterns
Use byte array manipulation to customize the templates rather than full ASM generation
This would reduce the overhead of ASM class generation

Lazy Loading:
Defer class generation until the subroutine is actually called
Currently all classes are generated eagerly during compilation
Lazy loading would improve initial compilation time

During initial parsing in SubroutineParser.java, instead of immediately generating the class via runSpecialBlock(), we could store just the AST node and metadata:
```
String fullName = NameNormalizer.normalizeVariableName(subName, parser.ctx.symbolTable.getCurrentPackage());
// Store AST + metadata for lazy loading
RuntimeCode code = new RuntimeCode(prototype, attributes);
code.pendingNode = subroutineNode;
GlobalVariable.getGlobalCodeRef(fullName).set(code);
```
Add support in RuntimeCode.java for lazy initialization:
```
public Node pendingNode; // Store AST until needed

public RuntimeList apply(RuntimeArray a, int callContext) {
    if (methodObject == null && pendingNode != null) {
        // Generate class on first use
        generateCodeFromNode(pendingNode);
        pendingNode = null; // Clear AST after generation
    }
    // Existing apply logic...
}
```

Shared Constant Pool:
Implement a shared constant pool across generated classes
Common strings and constant values could be referenced rather than duplicated
This would reduce memory usage across many generated classes

Direct Field Access:
For simple closure variables, generate direct field access code
Currently all access goes through getter/setter methods
Direct field access would improve performance for basic operations

Optimized Constructor Generation:
Generate specialized constructors based on closure variable patterns
Currently uses generic reflection-based construction
Specialized constructors would improve instantiation performance
