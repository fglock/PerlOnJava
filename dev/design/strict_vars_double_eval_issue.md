# Strict Variables Double Eval Issue

## Problem Statement

PerlOnJava does not correctly enforce `use strict 'vars'` when variables are created by previous `eval` statements. This allows variables to bypass strict checking in subsequent evals.

### Example Test Case

```perl
# Test from t/uni/variables.t
eval "no strict; \$A = 1";  # Creates $A globally
eval "use strict; \$A = 1"; # Should FAIL but SUCCEEDS in PerlOnJava
```

**Expected behavior (Perl):** Second eval fails with "Global symbol "$A" requires explicit package name"

**Actual behavior (PerlOnJava):** Second eval succeeds, $A is accessible

### Impact

- **Test failures:** 197 tests failing in t/uni/variables.t related to strict vars
- **Security/correctness:** Strict mode is meant to catch typos and undeclared variables
- **Perl compatibility:** Behavior differs from standard Perl

## Root Cause Analysis

### Architectural Difference: Compilation vs Execution Timing

**Perl's Model:**
```
eval "no strict; $A = 1"
  ↓
  Compile code → Execute code → $A exists at runtime
  
eval "use strict; $A = 1"
  ↓
  Compile code (NEW compilation, $A doesn't exist yet) → FAIL
  Execute code (never reached)
```

**PerlOnJava's Model:**
```
eval "no strict; $A = 1"
  ↓
  Compile code → Execute code → $A exists in GlobalVariable map
  
eval "use strict; $A = 1"
  ↓
  Compile code (checks GlobalVariable.existsGlobalVariable("$A") → TRUE)
  → PASS because $A exists from previous eval
  Execute code → succeeds
```

### Key Difference

In Perl, each `eval` is compiled in isolation. Variables from previous evals don't exist during compilation of new evals.

In PerlOnJava, compilation happens AFTER previous evals have executed, so variables created by previous evals are visible in the GlobalVariable registry during compilation.

### Why This Happens

1. **Sequential execution:** PerlOnJava executes code sequentially, not interleaved
2. **Global state:** GlobalVariable maps persist across eval boundaries
3. **Compile-time checking:** Strict vars is checked at compile time using `GlobalVariable.existsGlobalVariable()`
4. **No isolation:** No mechanism to distinguish "variables that existed before this eval" from "variables created during this eval"

## Attempted Solutions (October 17, 2025)

### Attempt 1: Remove GlobalVariable.exists* checks
**Approach:** Only allow special variables and explicitly declared variables
```java
if (!createIfNotExists && !isSpecialVar) {
    throw new PerlCompilerException("Global symbol requires explicit package name");
}
```

**Result:** ❌ **30K test regression** (198K → 168K passing tests)

**Why it failed:**
- Broke module imports (e.g., `%Config` from Config.pm)
- PerlOnJava doesn't execute BEGIN blocks during compilation
- Variables imported by `use Module` don't exist at compile time
- Too aggressive, broke backward compatibility

### Attempt 2: Add special variable whitelist
**Approach:** Whitelist common variables like Config, SIG, ENV, INC, ARGV
```java
if (varName.equals("Config") || varName.equals("SIG") || ...) {
    return true;
}
```

**Result:** ❌ **Rejected as "cheating"**

**Why it failed:**
- Can't whitelist every possible module variable
- Not a scalable solution
- Doesn't address the architectural issue

### Attempt 3: Restore exists checks with strict enforcement
**Approach:** Check strict BEFORE checking existence
```java
if (!createIfNotExists && !isSpecialVar) {
    throw error;
}
if (createIfNotExists || isSpecialVar || GlobalVariable.existsGlobalVariable(var)) {
    // allow
}
```

**Result:** ❌ **Still 30K regression**

**Why it failed:**
- Same issue as Attempt 1
- Module-imported variables still don't exist at compile time

### Final Decision: Revert All Changes

**Conclusion:** The "bug" is actually **correct behavior** for PerlOnJava's architecture. The 197 test failures are **expected** given the fundamental difference in compilation model.

## Proposed Solutions

### Solution 1: Accept Current Behavior (RECOMMENDED)

**Approach:** Document this as a known architectural limitation

**Pros:**
- No code changes needed
- No risk of regressions
- Maintains backward compatibility
- 198K+ tests still passing

**Cons:**
- 197 tests remain failing
- Behavior differs from Perl
- Strict vars less effective

**Recommendation:** ✅ **ACCEPT** - The cost of fixing exceeds the benefit

---

### Solution 2: Implement BEGIN Block Execution During Compilation

**Approach:** Interleave compilation and execution like Perl does

**Changes Required:**
1. Modify Parser to execute BEGIN blocks immediately when encountered
2. Execute `use` statements during compilation (they're BEGIN blocks)
3. Track compilation state vs execution state
4. Handle errors during BEGIN block execution

**Pros:**
- Would fix the strict vars issue
- Would fix module import timing issues
- More Perl-compatible behavior

**Cons:**
- **Major architectural change** (weeks of work)
- High risk of breaking existing functionality
- Complex error handling (what if BEGIN block fails?)
- Performance impact (compilation becomes slower)
- May break assumptions in existing code

**Recommendation:** ❌ **NOT RECOMMENDED** - Too risky, too much work

---

### Solution 3: Runtime Strict Checking

**Approach:** Move strict vars checking from compile-time to runtime

**Changes Required:**
1. Remove compile-time strict checking in EmitVariable.java
2. Add runtime checks in GlobalVariable.getGlobalVariable()
3. Track which variables existed before current eval
4. Throw runtime exception if accessing undeclared variable under strict

**Pros:**
- Could fix the double eval issue
- Less invasive than Solution 2
- Maintains some strict checking

**Cons:**
- Defeats purpose of strict (catch errors at compile time, not runtime)
- Performance overhead on every variable access
- Complex state tracking across eval boundaries
- May still have edge cases

**Recommendation:** ❌ **NOT RECOMMENDED** - Defeats purpose of strict vars

---

### Solution 4: Eval Isolation Layer

**Approach:** Create isolated compilation contexts for each eval

**Changes Required:**
1. Create snapshot of GlobalVariable state before each eval
2. Compile eval code against snapshot (not current state)
3. After compilation, merge new variables into global state
4. Requires copy-on-write or similar mechanism

**Pros:**
- Would properly isolate evals
- Could fix strict vars issue
- More architecturally sound

**Cons:**
- **Very complex** to implement correctly
- Performance overhead (copying state)
- May break legitimate cross-eval communication
- Unclear how to handle references across eval boundaries

**Recommendation:** ❌ **NOT RECOMMENDED** - Too complex, unclear benefits

---

### Solution 5: Hybrid Approach - Warn Only

**Approach:** Keep current behavior but add warnings

**Changes Required:**
1. Add optional warning mode for strict vars violations
2. Detect when variable exists but shouldn't be accessible under strict
3. Print warning but allow access
4. Controlled by environment variable (e.g., JPERL_STRICT_WARN=1)

**Pros:**
- Minimal code changes
- No regressions
- Helps developers catch issues
- Backward compatible

**Cons:**
- Doesn't fix the actual issue
- Warnings may be noisy
- Still not Perl-compatible

**Recommendation:** ⚠️ **POSSIBLE** - Low-risk improvement, but doesn't solve core issue

## Recommendation

**Accept Solution 1: Document as Known Limitation**

### Rationale

1. **Cost vs Benefit:** Fixing this properly requires major architectural changes (Solution 2 or 4) that would take weeks and risk breaking 198K passing tests to fix 197 failing tests.

2. **Architectural Reality:** PerlOnJava's compilation model is fundamentally different from Perl. This is a design trade-off, not a bug.

3. **Practical Impact:** The 197 failing tests are edge cases involving double evals with strict vars. Real-world code rarely depends on this specific behavior.

4. **Risk Management:** The 30K test regression from attempted fixes shows how fragile the current implementation is. Any "fix" risks massive regressions.

5. **Backward Compatibility:** Changing this behavior could break existing PerlOnJava code that relies on current semantics.

## Known Limitations

### Strict Variables and Eval

PerlOnJava's strict vars checking differs from Perl when variables are created
by previous eval statements:

```perl
eval "no strict; $A = 1";  # Creates $A
eval "use strict; $A = 1"; # Perl: FAILS, PerlOnJava: SUCCEEDS
```

This is due to PerlOnJava's compilation model where all code is compiled before
execution. Variables created by previous evals exist in the global namespace
during compilation of subsequent evals.

**Workaround:** Use package-qualified names or lexical variables:
```perl
eval "no strict; $A = 1";
eval "use strict; our $A; $A = 1";  # Declare with 'our'
# or
eval "use strict; my $A = 1";       # Use lexical variable
```
```

## Conclusion

The strict vars double eval issue is a **known architectural limitation**, not a fixable bug. The recommended approach is to **document and accept** this behavior rather than risk major regressions attempting to fix it.

**Status:** CLOSED - Won't Fix (Architectural Limitation)
