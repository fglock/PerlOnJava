## More Difficult, and Low Impact
- `goto()` to jump to a label in the call stack
- Thread
- Optimizations
- implement subroutine using JVM Function instead of Method

## Cleanup

## Runtime Format Error Messages and Warnings
- catch and reformat errors like division by zero

## Test Different Perl Data Types
- Experiment with `Perlito` style of JVM integration

## Local Variables
- Set up localization in for-loop

## Implement Thread-Safety

## GC
- Ensure GC works for classes
