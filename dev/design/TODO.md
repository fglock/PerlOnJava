# TODO

## More Difficult, and Low Impact
- `goto()` to jump to a label in the call stack
- Thread
- Optimizations
- implement subroutine using JVM Function instead of Method

## Cleanup
- Cleanup the closure code to only add the lexical variables mentioned in the AST

## Local Variables
- Set up localization in for-loop

## Implement Thread-Safety
- It may need locking when calling ASM

## GC
- Ensure GC works for classes
