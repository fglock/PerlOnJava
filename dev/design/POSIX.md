### Why use `jnr-posix`?

- **Direct POSIX Support**: Java doesn't natively provide access to low-level POSIX functions like `isatty()`, but `jnr-posix` allows you to call these native functions in a platform-agnostic way (without needing to write JNI).
- **Cross-platform Development**: If you are building an application that needs to run on Unix-like systems and require deep POSIX integration, `jnr-posix` provides a clean and simple way to do this in Java.
- **Reliable for TTY checks**: Using `isatty()` from the POSIX interface allows you to check if a file descriptor (e.g., `FileDescriptor.out`) is associated with a terminal, which is exactly what the Perl `-t` operator does.

### Example Implementation using `jnr-posix`:
```java
import jnr.posix.POSIX;
import jnr.posix.POSIXFactory;
import java.io.FileDescriptor;

public class TtyCheck {

    public static boolean isTty() {
        POSIX posix = POSIXFactory.getPOSIX();
        return posix.isatty(FileDescriptor.out);
    }

    public static void main(String[] args) {
        if (isTty()) {
            System.out.println("Filehandle is connected to a tty (terminal).");
        } else {
            System.out.println("Filehandle is not connected to a tty.");
        }
    }
}
```

### Why it makes sense:
- **POSIX Functions in Java**: This approach bridges the gap between Java and the POSIX environment, giving you access to `isatty()` without having to implement your own native interface.
- **Use case for Unix-like systems**: This method is particularly useful for Unix-like environments (Linux, macOS) where POSIX compliance is common.

### Things to Consider:
- **Platform Dependency**: `jnr-posix` works well in POSIX-compliant environments (Unix-like OS). However, it won't be useful on platforms like Windows unless you're running in a POSIX-compatible layer like Cygwin.
- **Additional Dependency**: You will need to include `jnr-posix` as a dependency in your project, so this adds a layer of external library management.

### Maven Dependency for `jnr-posix`:
If you are using Maven, you can add the following dependency to your `pom.xml`:
```xml
<dependency>
    <groupId>com.github.jnr</groupId>
    <artifactId>jnr-posix</artifactId>
    <version>3.0.50</version>
</dependency>
```
