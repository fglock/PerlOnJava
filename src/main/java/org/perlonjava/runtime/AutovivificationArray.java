 * they are accessed in a way that assumes they exist. This class holds a reference
 * to the RuntimeScalar that should be autovivified when the array is assigned a list.
 *
 * <p>For example, in Perl code like {@code @$array = ()}, if $array
 * doesn't exist, it will be automatically created. This class
 * facilitates such behavior by holding the scalar that needs to be autovivified.
