/**
 * TieScalar provides support for Perl's tie mechanism for scalar variables.
 *
 * <p>In Perl, the tie mechanism allows scalar variables to have their operations
 * intercepted and handled by custom classes. When a scalar is tied, all operations
 * on that scalar (fetching values, storing values, etc.) are delegated to methods
 * in the tie handler object.</p>
 *
 * <p>This class provides static methods that are called when operations are
 * performed on tied scalars. The actual tie handler implementation should
 * implement the {@code TieHandler} interface (to be implemented).</p>
 *
 * <p><b>Implementation Status:</b> This is currently a stub implementation.
 * The full tie mechanism requires:
 * <ul>
 *   <li>Adding a TIED type constant to RuntimeScalarType</li>
 *   <li>Creating a TieHandler interface with FETCH, STORE, UNTIE methods</li>
 *   <li>Updating all RuntimeScalar operations to check for TIED type</li>
 *   <li>Implementing tie(), untie(), and tied() methods on RuntimeScalar</li>
 * </ul>
 * </p>
 *
 * @see RuntimeScalar
