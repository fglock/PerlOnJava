      # Windows-specific build configuration to prevent Gradle daemon socket errors
      # Windows CI runners occasionally fail with "Connection reset by peer" errors
      # when Gradle daemon tries to communicate between processes.
      # Workarounds:
      # - Use Gradle wrapper (gradlew.bat) instead of gradle command for consistency
      # - --no-daemon: Disable daemon mode completely
      # - --no-parallel: Prevent parallel execution that can cause socket conflicts
      # - -Xmx2g: Increase heap size to prevent memory-related socket issues
      # - --stacktrace: Provide detailed error information if issues occur
