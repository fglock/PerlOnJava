# ASCII Art for Class Hierarchy

#     X     <--root parent class
#    / \

#     D     <-- child class

# C3 Method Resolution Order:
#
# C3 linearization ensures that each class appears in the method resolution order only after its parents have been considered. For class D, the C3 linearization would be:
# 
# D: Start with the class itself.
# B: Since D inherits from B and C, and B is listed first, it comes next.
# C: After B, C is considered.
# A: Both B and C inherit from A, so A comes next.
# Y: Since A inherits from Y and Z, and Y is listed first, it comes next.
# Z: After Y, Z is considered.
# X: Finally, X is the root class for both Y and Z.
# 
# Explanation of the Output:
# 
# X's speak method called: X is the root class, and its method is called first.
# Y's speak method called: Y is considered before Z due to the C3 order.
# Z's speak method not called: Z is not called because Y has already satisfied the requirement for A's parent.
# A's speak method called: A is called after Y.
# B's speak method called: B is called as it is the first parent of D.
# C's speak method not called: C is not called because B has already satisfied the requirement for D's parent.
# D's speak method called: Finally, D's method is called.
# 
# Conclusion:
# 
# The C3 method resolution order ensures that each class is only considered once, and it respects the order of inheritance specified in the class definitions. This is why Z and C's methods are not calledâ€”they are effectively "skipped" because their functionality is already covered by earlier classes in the resolution order.
