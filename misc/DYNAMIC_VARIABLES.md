To implement Perl dynamic variables:

# Implement parser:

This is done.

# Define Dynamic Variable Structure:

Ensure that the DynamicState interface is implemented by any class that represents a dynamic variable. This interface provides methods to save and restore the state of a variable.

Missing: Glob, IO Handle, Regex

Create a special case for Regex variables if needed.

Make sure %ENV changes get reflected in system calls.

Create a special case for `@_`, which is stored in JVM local vars.

# Manage Dynamic Variables with DynamicVariableManager:

Utilize the DynamicVariableManager to handle the stack of dynamic variables. This class already provides methods to push and pop dynamic states, which can be used to manage the lifecycle of dynamic variables.

# Integrate with ScopedSymbolTable:

Modify the ScopedSymbolTable to interact with DynamicVariableManager. When entering or exiting a scope, ensure that dynamic variables are appropriately saved and restored.

Use ScopedSymbolTable.allocateLocalVariable.

# Integrate with JavaClassInfo.loopLabelStack, LoopLabels, LocalOperatorVisitor, Return

Restore the variable state.

# Emit Code for Dynamic Variables in EmitStatement:

Update the EmitStatement class to generate the necessary bytecode for handling dynamic variables. This includes:
- Emitting code to save the current state of a dynamic variable when entering a new dynamic scope.
- Emitting code to restore the state when exiting the scope.

Ensure that the generated bytecode correctly interacts with the DynamicVariableManager to maintain the correct state across different scopes.

# Testing and Validation:

Implement comprehensive tests to ensure that dynamic variables behave as expected. This includes tests for variable shadowing, state restoration, and interactions with other variable types.

Validate that the dynamic scoping rules are correctly implemented and that variables are restored to their previous states after exiting a dynamic scope.
