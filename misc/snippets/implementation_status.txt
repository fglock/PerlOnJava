Here are some effective strategies to make the implementation status visible:
1. Documentation

Feature Matrix:

    Create a comprehensive feature matrix that lists all the features of Perl and their implementation status (e.g., "Implemented", "Partially Implemented", "Not Implemented", "Buggy").
    Example:

Feature 	Status 	Notes
Scalars 	Implemented 	Fully functional
Arrays 	Partially Implemented 	Missing some edge cases
Hashes 	Not Implemented 	
Regular Expressions 	Buggy 	Known issues with backreferences

Release Notes:

    Maintain detailed release notes for each version, highlighting new features, improvements, and known issues.

2. Interactive Tools

REPL (Read-Eval-Print Loop):

    Provide a REPL where users can experiment with the language and see which features are working.
    Display warnings or messages for features that are not yet implemented or are known to have issues.

3. Compiler/Interpreter Messages

Warnings and Errors:

    When users try to use an unimplemented or buggy feature, provide clear and informative warnings or error messages.
    Example:

    # User tries to use a feature not yet implemented
    warn "Warning: Feature 'X' is not yet implemented in this version.";

4. Website and Community

Project Website:

    Maintain a project website with a dedicated section for the implementation status.
    Include a searchable FAQ and a list of known issues.

Community Forums and Issue Tracker:

    Use platforms like GitHub Issues, Discourse, or a dedicated forum where users can report bugs, request features, and discuss the implementation status.
    Tag issues with labels like "bug", "feature request", "in progress", etc.

5. Versioning and Branching

Version Tags:

    Use semantic versioning to indicate the stability and completeness of releases (e.g., 1.0.0 for a stable release, 0.1.0 for an early development release).

Branches:

    Maintain separate branches for stable releases, development, and experimental features.
    Clearly indicate the purpose and stability of each branch in the repository.

6. Examples and Tutorials

Code Examples:

    Provide code examples and tutorials that demonstrate the implemented features.
    Clearly mark examples that use features not yet implemented or known to have issues.

7. Automated Testing and CI/CD

Test Coverage:

    Maintain a comprehensive suite of automated tests to ensure that implemented features work as expected.
    Use tools like JaCoCo for test coverage reports.

Continuous Integration:

    Set up a CI/CD pipeline to automatically run tests and build the project.
    Display the build status and test results on the project website or repository.

Example Implementation

Here's an example of how you might structure a feature matrix in your documentation:

# Perl on JVM Feature Matrix

## Scalars
- [x] Basic Operations
- [x] String Interpolation
- [ ] Tied Scalars (Not Implemented)

## Arrays
- [x] Basic Operations
- [ ] Array Slices (Partially Implemented)
- [ ] Tied Arrays (Not Implemented)

## Hashes
- [ ] Basic Operations (Not Implemented)
- [ ] Tied Hashes (Not Implemented)

## Regular Expressions
- [x] Basic Matching
- [ ] Advanced Features (Buggy)
