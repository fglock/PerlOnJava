The current documentation structure can be enhanced by:

Creating topic-specific guides:

- docs/GETTING_STARTED.md - Quick start and basic usage examples
- docs/JDBC_GUIDE.md - Detailed database connectivity guide
- docs/DEBUGGING.md - Move debugging tools section here
- docs/ARCHITECTURE.md - Move internal modules section here

Areas needing more documentation:

- Performance tuning and optimization guidelines
- Migration guides from Perl to PerlOnJava
- Common patterns and best practices
- More code examples for each major feature
- Troubleshooting guide with common issues

Reorganize existing files:

- Move all documentation to a docs/ directory
- Keep README.md focused on quick start and navigation
- Create an index page in docs/ listing all available guides
- Add cross-references between related topics

Add new documentation:

- Benchmarks and performance metrics
- Security considerations
- Integration examples with popular Java frameworks
- Community showcase of real-world usage
