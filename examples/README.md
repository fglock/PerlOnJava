# Examples Directory

This directory contains sample Perl scripts that demonstrate various features and capabilities of Perl.
These scripts are intended to serve as examples and reference material for developers.

Note:

- The Perl scripts in this directory are not part of the automated test suite.
  They are provided for educational and illustrative purposes.

- Automated tests for Perl scripts are located in the src/test/resources directory.
  These test files are executed during the build process by Maven/Gradle to ensure the correctness of the Perl code.

- To run the automated tests manually, you can use the following commands:
  - For Maven: `mvn test`
  - For Gradle: `gradle test`

  These commands will compile the Java code, run the Java and Perl tests, and generate test reports.

- Ensure that any new Perl scripts added to the src/test/resources directory follow the project's testing conventions.

- If you add new example scripts to this directory, consider documenting their purpose and usage to help other developers.
