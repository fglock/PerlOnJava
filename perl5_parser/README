experimental Perl5 parser

- handwritten grammar; faster than Perlito5 compiled grammar

- work in progress

- maybe eventually we will merge the good parts into Perlito5 main compiler

- experimenting with grammar generalizations and optimizations, and error reporting

- optimizations: reduce the number of function calls, reduce the number of string operations, reduce the number of backtrackings
